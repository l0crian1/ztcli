# ztcli
Contextual CLI for ZeroTier written in Python

Add the ztcli.py file to you zerotier-one folder (or One folder in Windows). Built in Python 3.9.

This is intended for lab purposes, I wouldn't use this on mission critical systems until you're confident it functions without issue in your environment.
